ðŸ”¹ What Are Built-in Modules?
Built-in modules are pre-installed with Python. You donâ€™t need to install them separately â€” just import and use them.

They help you:

Work with files and folders

Perform mathematical operations

Handle dates and times

Interact with the operating system

And much more!

Example: math, random, os, sys
