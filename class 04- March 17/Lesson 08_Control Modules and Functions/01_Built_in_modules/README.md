## 🔹 What Are Built-in Modules?

**Built-in modules** are pre-installed with Python. You don’t need to install them separately — just `import` and use them directly in your code.

These modules help you:

✅ Work with files and folders  
✅ Perform mathematical operations  
✅ Handle dates and times  
✅ Interact with the operating system  
✅ Generate random numbers  
✅ Manage system-specific parameters and functions  
... and much more!

### 🔸 Common Built-in Modules with Examples

#### 📐 `math` – Perform mathematical operations

```python
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))        # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)              # Output: 3.141592653589793
print(math.factorial(5))    # Output: 120
